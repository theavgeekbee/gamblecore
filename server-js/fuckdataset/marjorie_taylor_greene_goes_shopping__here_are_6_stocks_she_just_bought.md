While there's speculation that Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Republican congresswoman from Georgia, may be considering a run for governor or the U.S. Senate, she's not losing focus on building out her investment portfolio. Earlier this month, she went on a buying spree, picking up shares of [artificial intelligence](https://www.fool.com/terms/a/artificial-intelligence/) stocks (AI) as well as those from other industries.

In addition to **Apple** ([AAPL](/quote/nasdaq/aapl/) 1.91%), **Intel** ([INTC](/quote/nasdaq/intc/) 2.77%) and **Meta** **Platforms** ([META](/quote/nasdaq/meta/) 1.51%), Greene picked up shares of **Devon** **Energy** ([DVN](/quote/nyse/dvn/) 0.95%), **Norfolk Southern** ([NSC](/quote/nyse/nsc/) 1.47%), and **United Parcel Service** ([UPS](/quote/nyse/ups/) 1.19%). Although it's not clear exactly how much Greene invested in each stock, the regulatory filing she submitted reveals that each transaction on Feb. 11 was valued between $1,001 and $15,000.

Greene's been wise to artificial intelligence stocks for some time
------------------------------------------------------------------

Continuing to show the same enthusiasm for AI stocks that she [espoused last year](https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/07/23/marjorie-taylor-greene-loves-ai-stocks-here-are-5/), Greene picked up shares of [Apple](https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-to-invest-in-apple-stock/) and Meta in this latest go-round of purchases. Shortly before Greene's purchase, Apple had reported strong financial results for the first quarter of 2025, which included a company record for quarterly revenue: $124.3 billion. Additionally, Apple reported growth on the bottom line of the income statement, booking diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.40, a 10% year-over-year increase.

While Intel has fallen out of favor with the market over the past year, Greene has a more auspicious take on the [semiconductor stock](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/information-technology/semiconductor-stocks/). The Trump administration is prioritizing the domestic manufacturing of AI chips in the United States, something that JD Vance elucidated at the AI Action Summit in Paris earlier this month. Recognizing that Intel could benefit from this, the market bid Intel stock higher in the subsequent days since the company has numerous semiconductor fabrication plants located in the United States.

Similarly, Meta also reported impressive quarterly financial results in January. Growing revenue 21% compared to the same period last year, Meta reported Q4 2024 sales of a little over $48 billion. Looking ahead, the company plans on further expanding its leadership in [generative AI](https://www.fool.com/terms/g/generative-ai/) as it specified in the earnings press release that it "expects capital expenditures growth in 2025 will be driven by increased investment to support both our generative AI efforts and core business."

Putting more pop in the passive income stream
---------------------------------------------

Besides growth stocks that stand at the vanguard of the rapidly burgeoning AI industry, Greene showed the love to dividend stocks in her round of stock buying that preceded Valentine's Day. For one, the representative from the Peach State ventured into the oilfield, picking up shares of Devon Energy, [an exploration and production company](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/energy/oil-stocks/) with assets located in several basins, which is committed to rewarding shareholders with its dividend. Devon Energy recently announced a 9% raise to its quarterly fixed dividend in 2025 to $0.24 per share, and its stock currently provides a forward dividend yield of 3.9%.

Diversifying her sources of passive income beyond the energy [sector](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/), Greene bought railroad stock Norfolk Southern. After its stock dropped 4% in 2024, Norfolk Southern, a freight rail company that operates throughout the eastern U.S., has seen its stock rebound in 2024. Beating analysts' bottom-line estimates, Nortfolk Southern provided strong fourth-quarter 2024 financial results shortly before Greene picked up shares. The stock, with its 2.2% forward dividend yield, represents a more conservative option to income investing with its payout ratio that has averaged 46.3% over the past five years.

Since its initial public offering in 1999, logistics stalwart UPS has returned capital to shareholders through its dividend, which it has maintained or hiked higher for 25 years. Although shares of UPS plunged nearly 10% in January, this didn't dissuade Greene, who had previously bought UPS stock in January and November. The stock now provides a robust ultra high dividend yield of 5.6%.

Is now a good time to follow Greene's lead?
-------------------------------------------

While monitoring politicians' stock purchases is a valid strategy to gain insights for one's own portfolio, it's hardly wise to blindly follow their leads. For those committed to AI stocks, nonetheless, Apple, Intel, and Meta are all worthy considerations, offering different shades of exposure.

With respect to ramping up one's passive income streams, Devon Energy, Norfolk Southern, and UPS are also valid options. For those looking for a bargain, Devon Energy and UPS are particularly appealing since they're trading at discounts to their historical valuations.
