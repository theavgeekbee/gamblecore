**Celsius Holdings** ([CELH](/quote/nasdaq/celh/) -1.15%) has had a rough year, with lower sales amid a cautious consumer-spending environment. But Needham recently raised its price target from $38 to $40 following the company's latest earnings report.

Wall Street [price targets](https://www.fool.com/terms/p/price-target/) are usually estimates of where an analyst thinks the stock will trade in the next 12 to 18 months. They're not that meaningful for anyone with a long-term investing horizon. That said, the firm's bullish call implies a positive direction for the business that could signal a buying opportunity for investors.

What's impacting Celsius stock's performance?
---------------------------------------------

Celsius finished 2024 with revenue down 4% year over year in the fourth quarter and up 3% for the full year, a significant decline from the triple-digit growth the company reported as recently as 2023. Revenue is down as its largest distributor, **PepsiCo**, made major adjustments to inventory last year amid lower demand.

The long-term growth of the energy drink market is still a big opportunity for Celsius, which currently ranks third in market share behind Red Bull and **Monster Beverage**. On that note, the company's recent move to acquire Alani Nu could broaden the appeal of its products to a wider demographic.

Some investors may look at the $1.8 billion deal as a stretch for growth in a challenging environment. But Alani Nu seems to be an affordable way for Celsius to significantly increase market share and expand its beverage lineup with a new range of flavors. Importantly, it will be accretive to the company's earnings in the first year, according to management.

With a [forward price-to-earnings ratio](https://www.fool.com/terms/f/forward-pe/) of 28, Celsius doesn't have to return to triple-digit growth rates in order to reward shareholders going forward. Trading at approximately $27 per share as of this writing, it's uncertain if the stock will be able to rebound nearly 50% in the near term to reach Needham's $40 price target. But following the stock's 73% decline from its all-time high, the lower valuation is certainly providing investors with much better value and return prospects.
