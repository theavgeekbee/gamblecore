Shares of payment platform **DLocal** ([DLO](/quote/nasdaq/dlo/) -30.51%) were down 29% this week at 12:30 p.m. ET, according to data provided by [S&P Global Market Intelligence](http://marketintelligence.spglobal.com/).

DLocal reported fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday and missed analysts' expectations for sales and earnings per share. While its guidance to grow total payment volume (TPV) by 40% in 2025 is promising, the company and its shorter-term profitability woes worried the market.

High-speed growth, but at what cost?
------------------------------------

DLocal's payment platform solves for the complexities of trying to sell anything in an [emerging market](https://www.fool.com/terms/e/emerging-market-economy/). Offering over 900 payment options in roughly 40 countries, DLocal boosts its customers' conversion rates in emerging markets, home to over _2 billion_ people.

The company's platform is a no-brainer solution for some of the world's largest companies, such as **Amazon**, **Shopify**, **Netflix**, and **Spotify**. Growing alongside juggernauts like these, DLocal again delivered impressive TPV growth of 45% in Q4 -- even if this was below expectations.

However, the company's declining margins and take rate were the bigger concern. Although TPV was up 45% in Q4, revenue and [gross profit](https://www.fool.com/terms/g/gross-profit/) only rose 15% and 6%, while adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ([EBITDA](https://www.fool.com/terms/e/ebitda/)) _declined_ by 7%.

Similarly, the company's take rate (gross profit divided by TPV) slipped from 1.2% in Q3 to 1.1% after it had remained flat (an improvement) over the last three quarters.

In oversimplified terms, the volatile nature of operating in emerging economies can lead to short-term disappointments like this for DLocal.

What's next for DLocal?
-----------------------

Ultimately, DLocal remains a profitable enterprise that generates positive [free cash flow](https://www.fool.com/terms/f/free-cash-flow/) and will likely see continued TPV growth. Trading at 24 [times earnings](https://www.fool.com/terms/p/pe-ratio/) today and 16 times next year's earnings, [DLocal remains one of my favorite growth stocks](https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/02/21/1-spectacular-tech-stock-down-81-to-buy-hand-over/).

Interested investors will need to brace for volatility with this one, however.
