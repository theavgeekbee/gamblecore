Prediction: Broadcom Will Soar Over the Next 5 Years. Here's 1 Reason Why.
==========================================================================

Key Points

*   Off-the-radar Broadcom is the leading name of one critical but overlooked aspect of artificial intelligence data centers.
    
*   As of last year, roughly one-fourth of the company's business was AI-related.
    
*   The continued growth of artificial intelligence, however, could as much as quintuple this company's artificial intelligence business by 2027.

For artificial intelligence to begin its next chapter driven by extreme performance, it's going to need more high-performance hardware from Broadcom.

Obviously, nobody can predict the future with absolute certainty. Investors can, however, connect informational dots to create a probable picture.

To this end, a confluence of factors has set a very bullish stage for communications technology giant **Broadcom** ([AVGO](/quote/nasdaq/avgo/) 0.82%).

Broadcom's place in the AI movement
-----------------------------------

Unlike **Nvidia** or **Amazon**, who pretty much are industry darlings in the [artificial intelligence](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/information-technology/ai-stocks/) (AI) space, Broadcom hasn't been much in the AI limelight.

However, there's an issue of concern: AI driven data centers are hitting a wall. However, computer processing power isn't the problem; Nvidia's hardware is more than up to the task. The surprising bottleneck is the speed at which a rack of processors communicates with one another _within_ a data center. AI platforms are creating and processing digital data faster than it can be disseminated.

Enter Broadcom, which makes the tech connecting an AI data center's many processors. Its recently introduced Brocade G710 24-port 64G switch, for instance, can handle speeds up to 64 gigabits, while the entire switch itself boasts bandwidth of up to 1.5 terabytes per second.

That may not mean much to a layperson, but for data center operators, that blazing-fast speed opens the door to new artificial intelligence functionality.

And that's just one item on Broadcom's tech menu. Hyperfast (200 gigabits per second) digital signal processors and a 51.2 terabytes-per-second fiberoptic Ethernet switching platform are also part of its lineup.

Here comes the rush
-------------------

Data center interconnection [technology](https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/02/23/3-top-tech-stocks-to-buy-right-now/) is nothing new. However, it required the advent of artificial intelligence to highlight how little had been done of late to advance this interconnectivity tech. No other company is as well positioned as Broadcom to close this gap.

It's now starting to be closed in earnest though. As Broadcom CEO Hock Tan commented in December, the market for AI networking components could be worth $60 billion to $90 billion per year by 2027.

For the sake of comparison, while Broadcom enjoys a commanding lead of this market, it still only did a little over $12 billion worth of such business last year.
