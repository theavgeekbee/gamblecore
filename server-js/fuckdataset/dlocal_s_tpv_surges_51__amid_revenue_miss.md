Quarter Highlights and Financial Insights
-----------------------------------------

DLocal's fourth quarter depicted robust performance in several metrics. Revenue increased 9% year over year while TPV of $7.7 billion registered a striking 51% year-over-year surge. DLocal’s platform served varied sectors, showing its adaptability and strength across numerous industries despite regional disparities. Key markets included Argentina and Egypt, though Brazil faced operational hurdles due to regulatory shifts, impacting processing strength.

Impressively, gross profit reached a record $83.7 million, marking a 20% increase. However, gross margins saw compression, declining from 1.4% to 1.1% of TPV, underlining pressures on profit and spending. Adjusted EBITDA of $56.9 million reflected a 16% year-over-year growth, despite historical increases in operating expenses. Challenges stem from elevated spending in technology and marketing, underlining the necessity for improved cost management.

As geographic performance varied, Latin America contributed substantially to revenue, driven by success in Argentina and Mexico. Yet, issues in Brazil due to regulatory changes proved challenging. Africa and Asia continued growth momentum, with South Africa and Egypt performing well against the backdrop of Nigerian currency devaluation.

Future Outlook and Guidance
---------------------------

Looking forward, DLocal management forecasts consistent growth with projected TPV increase between 35%-45% and revenue growth between 25%-35% in 2025. Despite ongoing net take rate compression pressures signaling some profit challenges, management is optimistic about sustaining growth.

Strategic expansion remains on the agenda, with investments in technology and new markets. Close attention to cost management is emphasized along with capitalizing on fintech’s digital payment trends. As the payment landscape evolves, DLocal's capacity for innovation and adaptability will be critical as it strives to meet continued growth and investor expectations.
