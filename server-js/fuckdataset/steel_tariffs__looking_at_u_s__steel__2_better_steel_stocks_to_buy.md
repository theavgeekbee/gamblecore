Trading on a buyout deal might net you a small return, but two other steelmakers have been far better long-term investments.

In this video, Motley Fool contributors Jason Hall and Tyler Crowe break down the latest in the steel industry, what's happening with **U.S. Steel** ([X](/quote/nyse/x/) 3.26%) and its potential buyers, which include **Nippon Steel** ([NPSC.Y](/quote/otc/npsc.y/) 1.53%), **Nucor** ([NUE](/quote/nyse/nue/) 1.97%), and **Cleveland-Cliffs** ([CLF](/quote/nyse/clf/) 1.02%), and why **Steel Dynamics** ([STLD](/quote/nasdaq/stld/) 1.31%) and Nucor are better buys.
