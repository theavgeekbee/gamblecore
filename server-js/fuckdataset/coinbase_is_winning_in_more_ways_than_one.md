Coinbase won in court, and that sets up a brighter future.

**Coinbase** ([COIN](/quote/nasdaq/coin/) 3.48%) has won against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and is now freer to build on the blockchain in the U.S. What should investors look for to see whether Coinbase's momentum continues? The answer lies beyond crypto prices and with the non-trading business, as Travis Hoium highlights.
