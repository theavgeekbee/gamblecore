**The Honest Company** ([HNST](/quote/nasdaq/hnst/) 7.89%) held its fourth-quarter conference call on February 26, 2025, revealing insights into the company's ongoing transformation. Here are three key takeaways on the company's strategic direction and execution.

Strong Financial Momentum Through Transformation Strategy
---------------------------------------------------------

The Honest Company demonstrated that its multiyear transformation initiative (brand maximization, margin enhancement, and operating discipline) is delivering results, with record revenue and its first full year of positive adjusted EBITDA as a public company.

> We delivered revenue of $378 million, which was up 10% year-over-year, and our gross margins expanded 900 basis points to 38%. This was our highest annual revenue and gross margin ever as a company. We also delivered our first full year of positive adjusted EBITDA as a public company.
> 
> \-- Carla Vernon, CEO & Director

Wipes Category Driving Growth and Market Leadership
---------------------------------------------------

The company's strategic focus on its wipes portfolio has yielded promising results, establishing Honest as the market leader in a key category while expanding distribution and driving repeat purchases.

> Our wipes portfolio grew in strength and scale this year. Our wipes growth was due to increased velocities, the introduction of larger pack sizes and the launch of new innovations. And now according to tracked channel data, our Clean Conscious wipes have led us to the top spot as the Number 1 natural wipes brand across the country. In Q4, our wipes velocities were up 17% and repeat was up 26% for the year.
> 
> \-- Carla Vernon, CEO & Director

Strategic Shift Away from Direct-to-Consumer Operations
-------------------------------------------------------

In a significant strategic pivot, Honest plans to gradually move away from its direct-to-consumer fulfillment operations to focus on more profitable retail and digital partnerships.

> With the higher cost of shipping and fulfillment activities related to our DTC business and other related costs, we will continue to shift our focus and investments toward more efficient and scalable distribution models with our current retail and digital customers. As we move forward beyond 2025, we'll gradually transition away from honest.com as a shipping and fulfillment channel while ensuring that the site remains a resource for educating consumers, showcasing our complete product portfolio and driving consumers to purchase off-site.
> 
> \-- David Loretta, Executive VP & Chief Financial Officer

Looking Ahead
-------------

Management is targeting 4%-6% revenue growth and continued margin expansion in 2025. CEO Carla Vernon sees balanced growth across retail partners, with expansion opportunities across both existing and new retail channels.

With $75 million in cash, zero debt, and management expecting gross margins to hold steady, Honest appears well positioned to continue executing its transformation strategy.
