These 4 ETFs provide the foundation for a portfolio.

When it comes to building a stock portfolio that is well diversified and successful over the long term, one of the keys centers around the foundation of your portfolio. The easiest way to diversify a portfolio is through the use of exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which can be thought of as a basket of stocks.

In today's video, I will go through a 4-ETF portfolio that will provide stability, growth, and dividends. In addition, the holdings in this portfolio will feed off one another and keep you well diversified. One of those ETFs is the **Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF** ([SCHD](/quote/nysemkt/schd/) 1.31%).
