**Progyny** ([PGNY](/quote/nasdaq/pgny/) -1.53%), a pioneer in fertility benefits management, released its earnings for the fourth quarter on Feb. 27. The standout points were its impressive revenue and adjusted earnings per share ([EPS](https://www.fool.com/terms/e/earnings-per-share/)) results, both of which surpassed analysts' consensus predictions. Revenue reached $298.4 million, compared to an estimate of $277 million, while adjusted EPS of $0.42 far exceeded the expected $0.10. However, reasons for concern persist, among them the detrimental impact of losing a large client.

Overview of Progyny's Business
------------------------------

Progyny is an industry leader in reproductive health and fertility benefits solutions that develops innovative plans to deliver comprehensive treatments with better outcomes. Its standout offering, the Smart Cycle, simplifies and enhances fertility treatment access for members. In recent times, Progyny has focused on expanding its client base and maintaining high satisfaction among its members. The business emphasizes a data-driven approach and integrated pharmacy benefits, catering to members with holistic support during their fertility journeys.

The company's success is closely tied to its ability to drive superior clinical outcomes. These outcomes are achieved by factors like its comprehensive fertility designs, concierge services, and an integrated network of fertility specialists. However, potential challenges like client retention and maintaining high member engagement remain areas for continuous attention.

Notable Developments in the Quarter
-----------------------------------

During Q4, Progyny expanded its client network, ending the year with 473 clients, a significant increase from 392 a year prior. This meaningfully added to the number of covered lives for the company and contributed to its impressive 10.6% rise in revenue to $298.4 million.

Adjusted EPS saw a remarkable jump to $0.42, exceeding projections by 320%. This boost in earnings was primarily driven by effective operational efficiencies and higher gross profits.

This growth was supported by Progyny's innovative services, which continued to draw employers looking for comprehensive fertility solutions for their employees. Yet, the company faced setbacks, including the loss of a significant client, which affected its growth projection for 2025. Additionally, net income dropped from $13.5 million in Q4 2023 to $10.5 million in Q4 2024, largely due to a higher income tax expense related to stock-based compensation.

Variability in member engagement remains a concern -- while the trends are improving, consistent growth in this area is not assured. As such, future revenues and treatment utilization rates are less predictable.

Looking Ahead
-------------

For 2025, Progyny has projected somewhat conservative revenue growth in the range of 1% to 5%, to a level between $1.175 billion and $1.225 billion.

In addition, management's guidance range for adjusted EBITDA is $188 million to $201 million. Net income is forecast to range between $45 million and $53.9 million, an optimistic yet cautious outlook. Investors should closely watch the company's efforts to stabilize client relations and enhance member engagement, as these will be pivotal in its effort to achieve sustained growth.
